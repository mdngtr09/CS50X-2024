songs.db shows the top 100 songs for a listener in 2018, we can get a good sense of their “audio aura” by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of those tracks.

Energy: If their songs are mostly high-energy, this person probably loves upbeat tracks that make them want to move. Think of songs that get you hyped for a workout or a night out! If the energy is low, they might be more into chill tunes that help them unwind.

Valence: A high average valence means they’re drawn to feel-good songs that lift their spirits. They might have a playlist filled with happy, sing-along tracks! If the valence is low, it could mean they enjoy deeper, more introspective music that makes them think.

Danceability: If the songs are super danceable, this listener likely loves to hit the dance floor and have a good time. On the flip side, if the danceability is low, they might prefer music that’s more suited for lounging around or just enjoying with friends.

Critique of the Calculation Method
Now, while averaging these numbers gives us a snapshot, it might not tell the full story about what this listener really likes:

Missing Nuances: Averaging can be a bit simplistic. This listener might enjoy everything from pop hits to indie ballads, and those diverse tastes might get lost in the numbers.

Situational Tastes: People listen to different types of music depending on their mood or the situation. They could blast dance tracks at a party but opt for soothing melodies while relaxing at home. Averages might not capture those shifts.

Improved Methods
To get a better picture of someone’s musical vibe, we could try:

Weighted Averages: Giving more importance to the songs they play often can provide clearer insights into what they genuinely love.

Lyric Analysis: Digging into the lyrics for emotional content could help us understand the feelings behind their favorite songs.
